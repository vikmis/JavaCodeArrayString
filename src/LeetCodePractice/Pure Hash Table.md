Goal: Build raw HashMap / HashSet logic (existence, frequency, uniqueness, cycle).

217 – Contains Duplicate  -- done in Array

219 – Contains Duplicate II

136 – Single Number (use hashmap version, XOR is alternative)

242 – Valid Anagram (hashmap frequency version)

387 – First Unique Character in a String

202 – Happy Number (cycle detection with hashset)

49 – Group Anagrams (basic hash grouping, still pure)
