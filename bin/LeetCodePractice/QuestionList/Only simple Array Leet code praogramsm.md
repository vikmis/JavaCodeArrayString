# Curated Array-only (Easy, Logic-Building) Problems

(25 problems, LeetCode numbers ke sath — carefully selected, patterns skip kiye gaye)

## Level 1 – Basics (Warm-up, array traversal)

1929 – Concatenation of Array

1920 – Build Array from Permutation

2011 – Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations

1480 – Running Sum of 1d Array

1108 – Defanging an IP Address (stringish lagta hai, but simple array traversal hi hai)

1365 – How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number

1470 – Shuffle the Array

## Level 2 – Slightly Trickier (min/max, counting)

1431 – Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies

1295 – Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits

1342 – Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero

905 – Sort Array by Parity (basic even-odd separation)

1089 – Duplicate Zeros (in-place shifting practice) ---need dpractice  not donne in eclpse

1299 – Replace Elements with Greatest Element on Right Side ---need dpractice  not donne in eclpse

485 – Max Consecutive Ones

## Level 3 – Classical Array Easy

283 – Move Zeroes (do simple shifting method, not two pointers yet)

88 – Merge Sorted Array (start with new array, later optimize in-place)

268 – Missing Number (use sum formula, simple math)

136 – Single Number (first do with count/extra array, later XOR trick)

169 – Majority Element (first use counting, later Boyer–Moore)

66 – Plus One (carry propagation)

35 – Search Insert Position (linear scan for now, binary search later)

Level 4 – Slight Challenges (sorting, construction)

414 – Third Maximum Number (sorting based logic first)

217 – Contains Duplicate (first brute force, later HashSet)

697 – Degree of an Array (frequency counting, but you can try basic approach first)--- nahi banaya 

628 – Maximum Product of Three Numbers (do with sorting first)
