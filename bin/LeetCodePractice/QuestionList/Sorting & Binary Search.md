# 📌 Bucket 1: Binary Search Algorithm (priority order)

👉 Start from the pure basics, then go step by step into variations.

704 – Binary Search (foundation, classic template)

35 – Search Insert Position (tiny tweak of binary search)

278 – First Bad Version (binary search on monotonic boolean API)

69 – Sqrt(x) (binary search on number space)

74 – Search a 2D Matrix (binary search on 2D → flatten logic)

34 – Find First and Last Position (two binary searches)

33 – Search in Rotated Sorted Array (rotated case, key interview Q)

153 – Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array (pivot finding, complement to 33)

162 – Find Peak Element (binary search on slopes, non-sorted array twist)




# 📌 Bucket 2: Sorting Algorithm Based Problems (priority order)

👉 First learn merge/quick fundamentals, then apply them in interview-style problems.





	

##🔹 Merge Sort–style

88 – Merge Sorted Array (easy, direct merging)


912 – Sort an Array (implement merge sort for practice)










##🔹 Quick Sort–style

75 – Sort Colors (Dutch partition, very intuitive)


215 – Kth Largest Element in an Array (quickselect partition)

912 – Sort an Array (implement quick sort for practice)
