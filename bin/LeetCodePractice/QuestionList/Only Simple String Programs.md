#Curated String-only (Easy, Logic-Building) Problems

(25 carefully picked problems — patterns skip kiye gaye)

##Level 1 – String Basics (traversal, char ops)

709 – To Lower Case

1108 – Defanging an IP Address

1528 – Shuffle String

1678 – Goal Parser Interpretation

1221 – Split a String in Balanced Strings

1859 – Sorting the Sentence

1945 – Sum of Digits of String After Convert

## Level 2 – Palindrome, Reverse, Compare

344 – Reverse String (in-place char array reverse)

557 – Reverse Words in a String III (split + reverse each word)

58 – Length of Last Word

14 – Longest Common Prefix (basic scanning, later trie but skip for now)

125 – Valid Palindrome (skip regex → simple cleaning + compare)

242 – Valid Anagram (first sorting, hashmap later)

## Level 3 – Conversions

13 – Roman to Integer

12 – Integer to Roman (construct with rules)

67 – Add Binary

415 – Add Strings

28 – Implement strStr() (naive substring search)

20 – Valid Parentheses (stack based, still counts as string)

## Level 4 – Character Frequency / Construction

383 – Ransom Note (brute-force first, hashmap later)

387 – First Unique Character in a String

28 – Find the Index of the First Occurrence (same as strStr, repeated)

459 – Repeated Substring Pattern (brute-force checking substrings)

541 – Reverse String II (indexing practice, conditional reversing)

680 – Valid Palindrome II (allow one removal, brute force first, skip two-pointer optimal)
