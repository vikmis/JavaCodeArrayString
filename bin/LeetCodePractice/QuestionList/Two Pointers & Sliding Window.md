Goal: Master pointer movement + window size adjustments without mixing with heap/sorting.

🟢 Two Pointers (Classic Pure)

125 – Valid Palindrome

344 – Reverse String

11 – Container With Most Water

26 – Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

27 – Remove Element

283 – Move Zeroes

167 – Two Sum II – Input Array Is Sorted

88 – Merge Sorted Array

350. Intersection of Two Arrays II

392. Is Subsequence










Fixed-Size Sliding Window (5 problems)

643 – Maximum Average Subarray I (basic window sum / average)

1984. Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores

1456 – Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length (window on string)

1004 – Max Consecutive Ones III (binary string, flip at most K zeros → fixed size style but slightly flexible)

219 – Contains Duplicate II (actually hash+window, but fixed range logic, very popular)

1876. Substrings of Size Three with Distinct Characters

2379. Minimum Recolors to Get K Consecutive Black Blocks

2269. Find the K-Beauty of a Number

1343 – Number of Sub-arrays of Size K and Average ≥ Threshold (window counting)







🟡 Variable-Size Sliding Window (5 problems)

594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence

3090. Maximum Length Substring With Two Occurrences

3 – Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (canonical interview Q)

209 – Minimum Size Subarray Sum (classic shrink/expand window)

76 – Minimum Window Substring (harder but top asked)

159 – Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters (generalized version of Q3)

424 – Longest Repeating Character Replacement (very common FAANG Q)
