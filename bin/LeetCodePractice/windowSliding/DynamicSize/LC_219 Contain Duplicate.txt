Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return true if there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] == nums[j] and abs(i - j) <= k.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
0 <= k <= 105








ESY TO UNDERSTAND

The problem asks: "Is there any duplicate number in the array that appears within a distance of k from each other?"

nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3

The duplicate 1 is at indices 0 and 3.

The absolute difference is |0 - 3| = 3, which is <= k (3). So, it's true.
